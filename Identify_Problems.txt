The script runs the find command in every loop.
For each file, it scans the whole folder again to look for files with the same size.
The script only compares:
-the file size
-the file name without the extension

This does not guarantee that the files are the same. Two different files can:
-have the same size
-have the same base name
-but have completely different content.

There is no confirmation from the user about which file to delete.

Itâ€™s easy to accidentally delete files (there is a commented-out line for deleting).
