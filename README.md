The script searches for files in a given folder to find possible duplicates.
It uses the find command with the -print0 option. This helps handle file names with spaces or special characters.

For each file found, the script:
  gets the file size in bytes
  gets the file name
  removes the file extension

Then the script loops again to:
  look for other files in the folder with the same size
  get their names without the path and extension
  check that itâ€™s not the same file
  compare the base names without extensions

If it finds another file with the same base name and size, it prints a message about possible duplicates.
There is also a commented-out rm command in the script that would delete the duplicate file.
